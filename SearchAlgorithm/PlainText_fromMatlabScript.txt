Windows of Opportunities - MATLAB Script Explanation
1. Setting Recycling Levels
The script defines three levels for recycling:

High = 3
Medium = 2
Low = 1
These values will be used later in the recycling and reuse calculations.

2. User Inputs
The script prompts the user to input the following values:

U_value (Thermal transmittance, representing insulation efficiency)
Coating_number (Indicates the level of coating on the glass:
0 = High recycling
1 = Medium recycling
2 = Low recycling)
Glass_panel_number (Number of glass panels in the window)
Year (Year of window installation or evaluation)
3. Defining Limits
The script sets predefined limits:

Year limits:
1990, 2010, and 2025
U-value limits:
0.7, 1.2, 1.8 (used for reuse assessment)
4. Assigning a Default U-value (if not provided)
If the user does not enter a U_value, the script calculates it based on the year, number of glass panels, and coating number.

Conditions for Assigning U-value:

For years after 2010 (>2010)
If Glass_panel_number is 3, U_value = 0.4
If Glass_panel_number is 2, U_value = 1
For years between 1990 and 2010 (1990 < Year < 2010)
If Glass_panel_number is 3, U_value = 0.8
If Glass_panel_number is 2, U_value = 1.1
For years before 1990 (<1990)
If Glass_panel_number is 3, U_value = 1.9
If Glass_panel_number is 2, U_value = 2.7
5. Recycling Level Calculation
The recycling level is determined by the Coating_number:

Coating_number = 0 → High recycling
Coating_number = 1 → Medium recycling
Coating_number = 2 → Low recycling
6. Glass and Sash Reuse Conditions
The script evaluates whether the glass and sashes (window frames) can be reused based on Glass_panel_number and U_value.

ReuseGlass & ReuseSashes Conditions:
High reuse if:
Glass_panel_number = 3 and U_value < 0.7
Glass_panel_number = 2 and U_value < 1.2
Medium reuse if:
Glass_panel_number = 3 and 0.7 < U_value < 1.2
Glass_panel_number = 2 and 0.7 < U_value < 1.2
Low reuse if:
Glass_panel_number = 3 and U_value > 1.2
Glass_panel_number = 2 and U_value > 1.8
Since the same conditions are used for both ReuseGlass and ReuseSashes, they will have identical values.

7. Window Reuse Conditions
The script assesses the reusability of the entire window based on the year and U-value.

ReuseWindow Conditions:
High reuse if:
2010 < Year < 2025 and U_value < 0.7
Medium reuse if:
2010 < Year < 2025 and 0.7 < U_value < 1.2
1990 < Year < 2010
Low reuse if:
Year < 1990 and 0.7 < U_value < 1.8
Year < 1990 and U_value > 1.2
Summary of What the Script Does
Takes user inputs for U-value, coating level, glass panel count, and year.
Assigns a U-value if the user didn’t provide one.
Determines the recycling level based on the coating number.
Evaluates reuse potential for:
Glass panels
Sashes (window frames)
The entire window
Classifies reuse into High, Medium, or Low categories.
This script is essentially a decision-making tool for determining window sustainability based on insulation (U-value), coating level, number of glass panels, and year of installation.
